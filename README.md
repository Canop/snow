# snow
Make it snow on your web site.

[Live Demonstration](https://Canop.github.io/snow/)

* Snow piles up at the bottom of the screen
* Customizable: from a light snow to a blizzard
* Optionally restricted to a date range
* Dynamically controllable: start new snow falls and stop them
* Don't mess with the DOM: only one canvas is added
* Light and with no dependency

## Usage

Import the script:

    <script src=snow.js></script>

Then call the start function:

    snow.start();

or with some parameters:

```Javascript
snow.start({
    flakeCount: 1000,
    stickingRatio: 0.55,
    wind: -2,
    monthDayRange: "12/15-01/05", // only from mid December to January the 5
});
```

You can ask the snow to gently stop:

    snow.stop();

## Options
